This is a picture zoom "full screen" in a web page, which can open, close and move around with the minimum amount of javascript possible.

ZoomLight allows you to enlarge an image and scroll it both with:

* mouse pointer movement,
* mouse scroll (wonderful for trackpads)
* your finger (on touch devices)

# DEMO

See [presentation page and demos](http://verlok.github.io/zoomLight/).
