This is a picture zoom "full screen" in a web page, which can open, close and move around with the minimum amount of javascript possible.

ZoomLight allows you to enlarge an image and scroll it both with:

* mouse pointer movement,
* mouse scroll (wonderful for trackpads)
* your finger (on touch devices)

And now it can be integrated with Hammer.js to implement touch gestures, aka pinch!

# DEMO
